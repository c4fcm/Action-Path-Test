logs are stored at: /storage/emulated/legacy/Android/data/action_path

To access these logs type:
   platform-tools/adb shell
   cd /storage/emulated/legacy/Android/data/action_path
   cat geodata.txt

Currently, the logs do monitor the time and the current location but do not get the geofence correct, or the enter/exit status correct. I will have to refactor the logging system into its own AsyncTask rather than an Activity.
